  "description": "After recent changes in Graonian government, a new Arch-Patriarch bla bla bla... You probably know this information very well. But this time, it's something very different. Don't get me wrong, the new Arch-Patriarch has in fact been chosen. But he is not another old, decrepit politician but he is still a young man and was only a simple patriarch from Fjoerdia in the Graonian hierarchy before. He was popular in his region as he successfully fought with the corruption and was very different to his predecessors. He started his rule with the cabinet's reform and employed international agency to conduct the audit of the other public institutions. ",
