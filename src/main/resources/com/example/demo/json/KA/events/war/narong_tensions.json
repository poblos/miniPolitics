  "description": "A question of Narong island is one of the conflicts frozen after the last War of Hegemony. Formerly a Leukian overseas territory, Narong island is currently an independent republic, although inhibited mainly by Forebergian and Karlenese people. Tensions arouse after the last elections, when Karlenese party managed to secure majority in the country's Highest Council and limited the rights of the Forebergian minority. Foreberg threatened to intervene militarily if the law won't be withdrawn, but Karlenese still refuse to do it.",
