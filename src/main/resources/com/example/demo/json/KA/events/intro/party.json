  "description": "As the aftermath of the civil war, the old institutions were abolished and a parliamentarian democratic system was established. Almost a hundred years on, political scene remains stable as a few large parties dominated elections. After years in power, the old leader of the Republican Party of Kachakonya has retired a month ago. Before he left this world, he had managed to anoint you as his successor.
