Its main purpose is to to ammend every act the lower house passes in accordance to the Sivian teachings. However the fact the seat in the conclave is permanent and only members of the conclave can compete to become the head of State, which effectively exculdes anyone but the clergy in the highest eschelons of power. Reforming the conclave and the prequisites to become head of state will have many consequences, some of which we can't predict.",
