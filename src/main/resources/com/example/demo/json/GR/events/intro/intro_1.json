  "description": "Graonia... A nation founded by exiles of Rudia almost a millennium ago after they embarked on the Great Odyssey to find a new place they could call Home. Among many vessels that sailed in the Odyssey there was one which would inspire even the most hopeless sailors. Sixty meters in length, six decks and six hundred crewmen. Its name was The Ark of The Grey One - our God who bestowed his grace upon his chosen people and granted us the island of Graonia so we have our place under the Sun. Ever since, the faithful of Graonia worship The Grey One and their guides in faith are the priests and patriarchs of the Sivian Church.",
