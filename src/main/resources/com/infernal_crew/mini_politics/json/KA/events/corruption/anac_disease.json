  "description": "One of our ministers have been visibly unwell during a conference in Portmat. He couldn't walk straight so his Matheuchelles' counterpart had to hold his arm. The most talked about part of the visit is a video showing him trying to get back into the car through the trunk. His assistant commented that the disease that he caught during a visit to Anac was to blame, but evidence suggests otherwise.",
