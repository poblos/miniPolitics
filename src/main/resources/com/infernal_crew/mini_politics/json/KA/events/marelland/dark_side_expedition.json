  "description": "Marelland's history as the Kachakonyan base for the further southern exploration and expansion has always pushed their people to cross the boundaries of the unknown. Some say that it's the blood of their famous founder, Marell, that still circles in their veins and gives them those unthinkable ideas. Anyway, throughout the last century they have spent significant funds on exploratory missions to the dark-side of the Searth. We have also had some success in this field including our subarctic base on the Cedric's Peninsula and that's what probably made Marelland's president propose to us a brave idea of setting up, with a common effort, a permanent base much further west, on the land never lightened up by the rays of our star. As you have probably guessed already, this will require an enormous amount of money and effort, but who knows what will we find on the Dark Side.",
