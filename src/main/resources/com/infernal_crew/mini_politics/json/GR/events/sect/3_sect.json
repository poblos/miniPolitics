With the recently acquired knowledge of world writing systems you manage to decipher the paper. As it turned out it was written in ancient Transbezcan alphabet, mirrored and turned upside down. The message on the paper contains the words of a prayer recited only during Graonia's most important holiday - the day of The Pilgrims. Underneath there are two eight digit numbers and the words:'Arch-Patriarch. Alone.' What is the meaning of this?",
